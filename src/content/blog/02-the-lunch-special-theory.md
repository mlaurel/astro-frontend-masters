There are only three categories of food: soup, salads, and sandwiches. This is the Lunch Special Theory.

The Lunch Special Theory is a theory of food that states that all food can be categorized into one of three categories: soup, salads, and sandwiches. The Lunch Special Theory was created by a group of friends who were trying to figure out what to eat for lunch. They realized that there are only three categories of food: soup, salads, and sandwiches. This theory has been proven true time and time again by many people around the world. It's not just a theory anymore; it's an undeniable fact!
